Thank you for attending our workshop on small area population forecasting methods.  The purpose of the workshop was to freely disseminate the research outputs of Discovery Project (ARC Discovery Project DP200101480) to support researchers and practitioners working in this field.
Within this GitHub repository, we've provided the slides from our workshop. If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, here's a simple guide on how to download the resources:
•	To download all files simultaneously:
1.	Click on the green "Code" button.
2.	From the dropdown, choose "Download ZIP".
•	To download a specific file:
1.	Navigate to and click on the desired file.
2.	Once opened, look to the right side of the screen and click either "View raw" or the icon depicting a "downward arrow pointing into a tray". This action will initiate the download of that specific file.
We hope these resources prove beneficial in your endeavors. If you have questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.
